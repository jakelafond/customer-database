# Customer Database
In this project, you'll generate a page of all of your customers so you can browse at your leisure.

Often times you'll be given a set of data that you need to display in an easy to digest fashion. In this project, that data is a list of 12 of your customers. You'll need to style a document that looks similar to the mockup provide below that shows the list of your customers.

Inside of the starter_files, you'll find two files.

- index.html: Your working HTML file
- customers.js: Your customer data
You'll need to create your main.js and styles.css file and link them up properly. Once you do that, you'll need to use the object customers that is in the customers.js file to display the people on the page.

You should do your best to match the mockup as perfect as possible. The only thing you can omit is the blurred out SSN unless you attempt the Hard Mode listed below.

## Hints  

Before getting too deep, make sure to console.log() your customers object and inspect it thoroughly. This is based on real data received from the Random User API. You don't need to visit their site, but if you are curious you can read more about their API here. Everything you need for the mockup is listed in the data, including the user image.

You'll also want to make heavy use of Template Literals, as they will speed up your development greatly.

Lastly, we purposefully didn't include any HTML or CSS. That is completely up to you to make the decision on how you will handle that. We would suggest you spend a few minutes planning that out before getting started.

## Mockup

## Hard Mode  

You'll notice in the mockup, their SSN is listed. You should display this on the page as well, but have it be blurred out by default. Then on hover, allow the user to see it.
